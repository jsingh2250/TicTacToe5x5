This program implements a modified version of the TicTacToe game using JavaFX. Instead of using a 3x3 board in a conventional TicTacToe game, this program implements a TicTacToe game on a 5x5 board. The winning rule is also modified: The player who succeeds in placing five of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
